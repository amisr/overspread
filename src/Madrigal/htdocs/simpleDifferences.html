<h3 align="center">How is the simple data access interface different from the standard Madrigal interface?</h3>
<p>The simple Madrigal web interface is designed for a user who is using Madrigal for the first time, or only 
requires access to the most basic parameters. </p>
<p>When printing data, the user only sees data in the Madrigal file that has associated error measurements. 
No parameters without associated error measurements are shown, and no derived parameters can be displayed. 
No filtering of the data is possible - the <em>Print data</em> page displays every record in the time ranges 
selected.</p>
<p>When plotting data, the user can only choose to plot parameters that have associated error measurements. 
No parameters without associated error measurements  and no derived parameters can be selected. No filtering 
of the data is possible - the <em>Plot data</em> page displays every record in the time ranges selected </p>
<p>To move beyond these limitiations, users should select some other data access method from the 
<a href="/cgi-bin/madrigal/accessData.cgi">data access page</a>. A tutorial on these ways of accessing Madrigal data is 
available <a href="madContents.html">here</a>. </p>
