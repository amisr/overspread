  <h1>Brief history of Madrigal </h1>
</center>
<p>Madrigal is a database of ground-based measurements and models of   the Earth's upper atmosphere and ionosphere. It is closely related to the   Coupling, Energetics and Dynamics of Atmospheric Regions (<a href="http://cedarweb.hao.ucar.edu/index.html">CEDAR</a>) program, which   is devoted to the characterization and understanding of the atmosphere above   about 60 km, with emphasis on the various processes that determine the basic   structure and composition of the atmosphere, and on the mechanisms that couple   different atmospheric regions. Instruments developed or upgraded under CEDAR   include interferometers, spectrometers, imagers, lidars and medium,   high-frequency and incoherent scatter radars. Models developed with CEDAR   support or incorporating CEDAR data include first-principle global circulation   models, and empirical models of temperature, density and winds. The success of   CEDAR has been due, in large measure, to its ability to encourage collaborative   efforts coalescing observations, theory and modeling. The CEDAR community   includes about 800 scientists and students from around the world.</p>
<p>From the inception of the CEDAR program in 1988, there has been a   great concern among the members of the CEDAR community to make the data   collected by the CEDAR instruments easily accessible for joint studies.   Consequently, a high priority was placed on establishing a repository for CEDAR   data and model results. An incoherent scatter radar database had been   established at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in 1985, and   this evolved into the CEDAR Database in 1989. By the end of 1997, it had grown   to include data from 44 instruments and 16 models. Over 200 users have requested   information from the Database.</p>
<p>A central element of the CEDAR Database is a standard data format.   This format evolved from the format used by the earlier incoherent scatter   database, which in turn evolved from an earlier version of Madrigal developed at the MIT Haystack   Observatory in 1980. Haystack continues to maintain and develop  Madrigal as an open-source project with community contributions. The basic Madrigal data format is the same as at NCAR, and   data files are easily exchanged between the two sites, but Madrigal has a   significantly different emphasis. The function of NCAR in the CEDAR Data Base is   first of all to archive a comprehensive collection of CEDAR data. Madrigal, on   the other hand, has evolved into a robust, World Wide Web based system capable   of managing and serving archival and real-time data from a wide variety of CEDAR   instruments. The Madrigal database is focused on data that is being actively maintained by the groups that produced the data. With the Madrigal database, the site owner stores only their own data, which they can add to or update at any time. However, because the Madrigal database shares its metadata with all other Madrigal sites, users browsing any Madrigal site can search for data at any other Madrigal site. </p>
<p>CEDAR is now poised to realize the full scientific potential   anticipated at its inception. CEDAR's scientific directions and future   operational requirements were detailed in 1997 in the CEDAR Phase III Report.   The report states that &quot;CEDAR must continue to capitalize on the latest   advancements in order to accomplish the best science most effectively. Where   practical and advantageous, remote continuous autonomous operation of CEDAR   instruments ought to be encouraged. Computer-aided collaborations, CEDAR   Database use, and CEDAR program information should be available to the CEDAR   community over the World Wide Web. Computer-aided collaborations and real-time   access to data and predictive models should be encouraged.&quot; Madrigal   is a key component to meeting these goals.</p>
<p>Madrigal data are arranged into &quot;experiments&quot;, which may contain   data files, images, documentation, links, etc. Almost all Millstone Hill Radar   experiments since 1976, over 900 experiments in all, as well as many   measurements by other instruments, are now available on-line. Each experiment   has a unique URL, which serves to map the database contents into the World Wide   Web, and is the fundamental mechanism through which the database can be   distributed among multiple servers.  An key feature of Madrigal is its  seamless integration   of archival and real-time data. A realtime file on Madrigal is accessed in exactly the same way as any archival file.</p>
<p>Madrigal has been installed at several locations in addition to   Millstone Hill, including EISCAT, SRI International, and Jicamarca. The inventories of   experiments available at each installation are available to the other   installations through a cgi script. Typically each installation retrieves   inventories from the other sites and updates a combined experiment list once a   day. Users can view the combined inventory and seamlessly retrieve data   regardless of where the data is actually stored.</p>
<p>Madrigal is an open source project with a central <a href="http://www.openmadrigal.org">Web site</a> . A complete CVS archive of all   Madrigal software, including software which is not included with the standard   distribution, is available there. There is also an Open Madrigal mailing list   and developer's forum. Any group wishing to install Madrigal to distribute their instrument's data is welcome to - see the www.OpenMadrigal.org web site for details. </p>
